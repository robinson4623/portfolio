## About

> My love of software development was sparked as I would sit with software engineers to review requested features or bugs in the code. It fascinated me as I was able to see, at a high level, what was being done and often what the issue was. The thing I lacked at the time was the understanding of the programming languages needed to be able to make the changes personally. 

Through this experience I was able to develop a deep skill set in problem solving, contributing as a high performing team member, and translating the needs of our clients to the live product. This gave me the background to understand software engineering from a business operations and an end-user perspective.

Iâ€™m am excited about the future of software engineering and architecture. I am open to all opportunities with an innovative team working to deliver the best product possible.
